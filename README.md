# Car make model and year classifier
The models are trained on the Cars Dataset. Given an image of a car, the models can predict the car's make, model and year of production.

The models are trained using Monk, which is a low code Deep Learning tool and a unified wrapper for Computer Vision.

The detailed instructions and commands to install the required libraries and datasets are included in the notebook.

The training was completely done on Google Colab.
